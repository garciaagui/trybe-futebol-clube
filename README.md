## Description

**25th project** of the [Trybe][trybe-site-url] Web Development course.

TFC is a full-stack application that provides information about games and soccer rankings.

I was responsible for developing the dockerized back-end using data modeling through Sequelize so that the front-end could properly consume the API data. The architecture follows the MSC model and the principles and concepts of OOP and SOLID were applied.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Front-end was developed and provided by Trybe.

<details>
  <summary><strong> üß± If you want to go deeper into the structure of the project, just click here.</strong></summary><br />

The project consists of 4 entities:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Database:**

- It is a pre-configured MySQL docker container in the `docker-compose` file through a service defined as `db`.
- It is responsible for providing data to the back-end service.
- You can also connect to a MySQL client (Workbench, Beekeeper, DBeaver, etc.), using the credentials configured in the `docker-compose` file for the `db` service.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Back-end:**

- Runs on port `3001` of `localhost`, which is the default port for the front-end to make requests;
- The application is initialized from the `app/backend/src/server.ts` file;
- `express` is executed and the application listens on the port from the environment variables;
- All extra dependencies (such as `joi`, `boom`, `express-async-errors`, etc.) must be listed in `app/backend/packages.npm`.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Front-end:**

- Runs on port `3000` of `localhost`;
- The front-end communicates with the back-end service through the URL `http://localhost:3001`.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Docker:**

- The `docker-compose` file is responsible for joining all containerized services (backend, frontend, and db) and running the entire project with the command `npm run compose:up` or `npm run compose:up:dev`.

## Features

<ul>
  <li>There are three ways to view the ranking: overall (which includes all matches), home games, and away games.</li>
  <li>It's possible to view the results of finished games and those that are still in progress.</li>
  <li>With the logged-in <strong>admin</strong> user, it's possible to edit the scores of matches in progress and finish them. Matches that have already ended cannot be changed.</li>
  <li>With the logged-in <strong>admin</strong> user, it's possible to add a new match.</li>
</ul>

## How to Run

To run the project locally, follow the steps below.

1. Verify that your machine meets the minimum requirements for running the project;

- Unix Distribution Operating System;
- Node version equal to or greater than `16.14.0 LTS`;
- Docker;
- Docker-compose version equal to or greater than `1.29.2`.

2. Clone the repository;

```
git clone git@github.com:garciaagui/trybe-futebol-clube.git
```

3. Navigate to the root of the project;

```
cd trybe-futebol-clube/
```

4. At the root of the project, install the dependencies with the command below;

```
npm run postinstall
```

5. At the root of the project, go to the app directory and run the command below to start the containers. By doing so, three containers will be initialized:

- **app_backend**: related to the back-end;
- **app_frontend**: related to the front-end;
- **db**: related to the database.

```
cd app/ && npm run compose:up:dev
```

6. In your browser, visit `http://localhost:3000`. If everything went well, you should be able to use the application.

- To run the back-end tests, go to the `app/backend/` directory and use the command below.

```
npm run test:coverage
```

- To start the application outside the container and connect to your local database, follow the steps below.

1. Go to the `app/backend/` directory;
2. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`;
3. Configure the values according to the scenario of your environment (database credentials, desired secrets, etc.).
